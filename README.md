# ATtiny-Chainy üîë

## Overview
ATtiny-Chainy is an innovative, compact circular development board that reimagines the potential of microcontroller design for makers and electronics enthusiasts. Built around the powerful Microchip ATtiny85 microcontroller, this board transforms the concept of a traditional development platform into a versatile, portable, and user-friendly solution. The ATtiny85 is a high-performance, low-power 8-bit AVR RISC-based microcontroller that packs significant capabilities into a tiny package. With 8KB of in-system programmable flash memory, 512 bytes of EEPROM, and 512 bytes of internal SRAM, this microcontroller offers robust functionality for a wide range of embedded projects. Its ability to operate at clock frequencies up to 20 MHz and support for various communication interfaces makes it an ideal choice for small-scale, creative electronics endeavors.
